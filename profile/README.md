## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ We're EchidnaHQ, a tiny development team developing lovely quirky open source magics 🧙. 

🥰 We love Rust, Linux, and the GNOME stack.
<!-- 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know? -->

☺️ [We're on Discord](https://discord.gg/BJusUKd8Vj )!

😍 Love you all! 💖✨ <3
